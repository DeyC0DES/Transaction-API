# **TRANSACTION API PROJECT**

### Hey :D Im Dey Codes and this is another one of my projects. Late at night i was thinking about a transaction system, thinking about its your complexity, so, i made a simple api that simulates a transaciton system (its just a simulate)

# **STUFFS**

In this project i use basically the same configuration as anothers project, but i upgraded my logic and changed the way i write the code. I use the spring boot framework and this is the dependencies:

### ○ Spring Web 
### ○ Spring Data Jpa 
### ○ MySQL Driver 
### ○ Spring Security 
### ○ Lombok 
### ○ Valid 

#

To create an admin account when registering use the name "admin.hkf43b" you can change this, put your logic to got admin role.
